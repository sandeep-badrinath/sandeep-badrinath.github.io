== About me

I received my PhD from the Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). During my PhD, I was fortunate to be advised by [http://web.mit.edu/hamsa/www/ Prof. Hamsa Balakrishnan]. Before joining MIT, I received a dual degree (B.Tech. + M.Tech.) in Aerospace Engineering from the [https://www.iitm.ac.in Indian Institute of Technology Madras]. My research broadly focuses on system modeling, design of control and optimization algorithms, with applications to air traffic management.


== Research
My research interests include 
- Queuing systems  
- Applied controls and optimization
- Air traffic management
